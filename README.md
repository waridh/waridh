## Brief History

### Microchip

In my latest internship, I was a Product/System Validation Co-op at Microchip Technology inc. at the Burnaby campus. I was in the DCS division, which handles PCIe switches and SAS initiators and expanders. The sub-team I was in mainly handles SAS devices, and I spent my time running post-silicon validation. I was also given the opportunity to further develop testing infrastructure as a part of my responsibility.

### Center for Smart Transportation

Previously, I have worked as a research assistant in the Department of Civil Engineering, where I researched
ways to process point cloud data, along with some simulation and data collecting work.
